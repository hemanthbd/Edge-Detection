# Edge-Detection

Program to illustrate various Edge Detection methods- Canny, Laplacian, Sobel

(Common for all- Laplacian, Sobel & Canny)

(a) Read the image 'bird.jpg'
(b) Display the image.
(c) Perform Laplacian Operation by using cvLaplace and display the resulting laplacian edge-detected image.
(d) Perform Sobel Operation by using cvSobel and display the resulting Sobel edge-detected image.
(e) Perform Canny-Edge Operation by using cvCanny and display the resulting Canny edge-detected image.

Instructions to Run :

(a) After compiling, and running you will be asked to choose which operation you would like to perform
- 1.Laplace  2.Sobel  3.Canny  4.Abort
(b) Choose anyone by typing in "1" or "2" or "3" or "4", whichever suits the corresponding edge detection scheme.
(c) For Ex: If you type 1, the Laplacian Operation will be conducted, and the input and Laplacian edge detected images will be displayed.
(d) Then it will ask you to choose for an another edge-detection operation.
(e) If finished type 4 to abort.
